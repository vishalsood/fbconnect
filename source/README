1. Install the module Fconnect under the directory <SiteRoot>/modules/fconnect 
2. Download the Facebook client library located at http://svn.facebook.com/svnroot/platform/clients/packages/facebook-platform.tar.gz. 
3. Copy the files under the directory <SiteRoot>/modules/fconnect/facebook-client, where <SiteRoot> is the root of the site. 
4. Next you will need to get application key and secret. To get that, create a facebook application. Visit http://www.facebook.com/developers/#/developers/createapp.php and fill up the form. Make sure your callback URL points to the site root (E.g., www.samplesite.com) 
5. Go to the module settings admin page and fill up the key/secret you get from Facebook. These settings will be available at <SiteRoot>/admin/settings/fconnect. 
6. Setup the Facebook Connect Block settings. You will see a new “Facebook Connect” block at <SiteRoot>/admin/build/block. Click configure to set properties.
